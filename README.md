# MauiUICollectionView
This is an experiment with a custom CollectionView, which does not use the native UICollectionView/RecyclerView, but is based on Maui's ScrollView, and the FlatList in ReactNative is also based on ScrollView, so it is feasible.

We know UICollectionView/RecyclerView is a high performance way to show list, they get high performance by recycle view. In this library, i also do it.

## Features
- Cross Platform, as long as the ScrollView behaves consistently
- Support for custom layouts
