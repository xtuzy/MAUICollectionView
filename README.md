# MAUICollectionView
- This is an experiment with a custom CollectionView, which does not use the native UICollectionView/RecyclerView, but is based on Maui's ScrollView. This idea from FlatList in ReactNative and iOS's TableView, they are base on ScrollView.

- We know UICollectionView/RecyclerView is a high performance way to show list, they get high performance by recycle view. In this library, i also do it.
- And most importantly, we can control all detail about CollectionView, you can custom a layout to get best performance to show your data.

Demo:
- Android
